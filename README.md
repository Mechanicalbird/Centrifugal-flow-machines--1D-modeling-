# Centrifugal-flow-machines--1D-modeling-

This Project has been done by the EES programming language, because it has the ability to perform an optimization process, for the centrifugal governing parameters, by just inserting the parameter value limits and, the optimal accuracy, in this project there is no optimization process, but the model has been built to do so.
