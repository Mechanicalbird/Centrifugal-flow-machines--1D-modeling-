# Centrifugal-flow-machines--1D-modeling-
This project is modeling a centrifugal compressor , by using 1-D analyses are based on a finite control volume analysis and yield predictions of the mass averaged output conditions without performing detailed modeling of the entire flow path, the model also use a loss calculating model that is been developed by NASA.

This Project has been done on EES program, because it has the ability to perform an optimization process, for the centrifugal governing parameters, by just inserting the parameters value limits and, the optimization accuracy, in this project there are no optimization process, but the model has been done to do so.
