# Centrifugal-flow-machines--1D-modeling-
This project is modeling a centrifugal compressor , by using 1-D analyses are based on a finite control volume analysis and yield predictions of the mass averaged output conditions without performing detailed modeling of the entire flow path, the model also use a loss calculating model that is been developed by NASA
